Run the executable (make sure your MC launcher is closed)
Check "Install Vivecraft with Forge" and "Custom Version"
In "Custom Version" put 36.2.19
Under RAM allocation do like 8 gigs or something idfk
Nothing else matters it's all up to you

(You have to do this or you can't see VR player animations)
NOTE: ViveCraft comes with OptiFine by default.
